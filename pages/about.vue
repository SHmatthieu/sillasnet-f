				Cybersecurity is a top concern for businesses of all sizes.
				However, small and medium-sized businesses often have limited
				resources to allocate to cybersecurity, which makes them
				particularly vulnerable to attacks. This is why the project
				presented aims to provide a platform that will allow these
				companies to easily access information and solutions to improve
				their cybersecurity. The proposed scoring approach is a
				practical tool that will allow users to understand the threat
				and make informed decisions to protect their data and
				infrastructure.
